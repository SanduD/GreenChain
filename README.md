# GreenChain: Blockchain-Based Eco-Friendly Application

GreenChain is an innovative platform designed to incentivize eco-friendly behaviors using blockchain technology. The application rewards users with GreenCoin (GRC) for activities that reduce their carbon footprint, such as recycling PET bottles, using public transportation, and saving electricity.

## Context

In the current national context, the RetuRo program encourages recycling by requiring consumers to pay a deposit for products with PET packaging, which is refunded upon returning the empty bottles. GreenChain complements this initiative by transforming these deposits into digital credits on its platform, providing users with more flexibility on how and where to use their rewards.

## Project Description

GreenChain integrates modern technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. The application includes functionalities such as user registration and login, blockchain connectivity, and the management of the GreenCoin cryptocurrency. The main features include:
- **User Registration and Login**: Utilizes Google OAuth2.0 and Firebase Authentication.
- **Blockchain Connectivity**: Users connect their wallets via WalletConnect.
- **Main Screen**: Displays user activities and available rewards.
- **User Profile and History**: Tracks user activities and earned rewards.
- **Wallet Management**: Manages GreenCoin balances.
- **Activity Scanning**: Users can scan bus tickets, utility bills, and PET bottles to earn rewards.
- **Recycling Centers**: Identifies nearby recycling centers.

## Results

The application has successfully integrated multiple technologies to create a user-friendly and attractive platform for all age groups. It demonstrates the potential of blockchain technology in promoting sustainability by offering an engaging way for users to participate in eco-friendly activities and earn rewards.

## Conclusion

GreenChain is a significant step towards leveraging modern technologies to address environmental challenges. It highlights the utility of blockchain in promoting sustainable behaviors and offers an attractive, accessible application for users. This project underscores the potential of technology to drive positive environmental impact and foster a greener, more responsible community.
